	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Grant is a software developer from Birmingham.</p>

	<p>Graduating from university in 2009 with a 1st in Computer Science, he jumped straight into the industry coding websites and, later, mobile applications too.</p>

	<p>He doesn't always write about himself in the third person, but when he does it's because he wants to sound like a robot (or when he's trying to be professional and write a bio like this). The human side of Grant likes <a href="/category/music">music</a>, <a href="/category/cooking">cooking</a> and spending time with his wife and sons.</p>

	<p>He is currently working as part of the Solution Development team at <a href="http://www.bcu.ac.uk" target="_new">Birmingham City University</a>.</p>

	<p>You can contact him by email on <a href='m&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#37;67&#37;72a%&#54;Et&#106;a&#109;es%40%6&#67;iv&#37;65&#46;&#99;o&#46;uk'>g&#114;antjam&#101;s&#64;live&#46;c&#111;&#46;uk</a></p>
