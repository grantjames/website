	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Grant is a software developer from Birmingham.</p>

	<p>Graduating from university in 2009 with a 1st in Computer Science, he jumped straight into the industry coding websites and, later, mobile applications too.</p>

	<p>He doesn't always write about himself in the third person, but when he does it's because he wants to sound like a robot (or when he's trying to be professional and write a bio like this). The human side of Grant likes <a href="/category/music">music</a> (both playing and listening to), <a href="/category/cooking">food</a> (cooking and eating) and spending time with his wife and son.</p>

	<p>He is currently working as part of the Solution Development team at <a href="http://www.bcu.ac.uk" target="_new">Birmingham City University</a>.</p>

	<p>You can contact him by email on <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x67;&#x72;&#x61;&#110;&#116;&#x40;&#103;&#45;&#106;&#x61;&#109;&#101;&#x73;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x2e;&#117;&#x6b;">&#103;&#114;&#x61;&#110;&#116;&#64;&#x67;&#x2d;&#x6a;&#x61;&#x6d;&#101;&#115;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#46;&#117;&#x6b;</a></p>
